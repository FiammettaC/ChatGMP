          <!--<p class="botText"><span>I am trained to answer questions regarding Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP).</span></p>-->
  
          <p>The Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) offers a course on <a href='https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/2023-2024/28855'>Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)</a>. 
            As part of the course, students are required to participate in an audit exercise (i.e., audits are used in order to evaluate a company's GMPs), where they assume the role of an auditor investigating a company, represented by teachers, about their good manufacturing practice. 
            During the audit, students can ask questions about the available documents and practices adopted by the company, which is necessary information to evaluate whether the company in question could be a valuable business partner or if detected non-conformities are too severe. 
            The role of teachers is to provide accurate answers, in case the documents are available, or vague responses, leaving students to reflect on the company's behavior. </p>
            
            <p> After a few years of participating in the aforementioned audit exercise, the teachers have agreed to investigate the replacement of the physical teacher with an AI-powered virtual tutor, <b>ChatGMP</b>. 
            The course is generally quite discursive, and the regulations and documentation are straightforward to discuss, so it poses a suitable use case for the application of AI.
            In practice, the tool consists of a pre-trained question-answering (QA) Transformer-based model.</p>
            
            <p> The purpose of this initiative is two-fold: (i) to improve the learning experience of chemical engineering students and increase their engagement by providing stimulating material and gamification, and (ii) to allow for substantial time savings for the teachers. 
            To be noted is that this initiative does not aim to move towards a teacher-less course, but rather to help teachers focus on the lectures and material preparation instead of exercises that, as important as they can be for the students' learning, are very time-consuming and quite repetitive in the long run.</p>
